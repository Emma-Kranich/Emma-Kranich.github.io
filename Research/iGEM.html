				<h4>2018 - Present</h4>
				<p>
				I'm a member of the product development subteam for Cornell iGEM. Every year, we design and build a project for the international competition in Boston, MA. The product development team utilizes the genetically engineered bacteria that our wetlab team creates and makes a functional product that can be used in the real world. We explore user needs, make problem statements, design and prototype, create specifications, and prepare for manafacturing. 
				<br/><br/>
				As a member of the product development team, I've learned about design thinking, prototyping, CAD, circuitry, and got machine shop training. I've also learned a lot by working on a team where each member has such a different background and skill set. It was amazing to learn from my peers in areas I wasn't comfortable with, as well as to teach fellow members in areas that I was. There is no way any one of us could have pulled off this project and it was amazing to see it come together with teamwork. In addition, our full project team consists of members not even in STEM on the business and policy and practice subteams. It was a great experience learning to communicate technical aspects to them and to learn about finance from them in simple terms.

				2019 Project - reHAB<br/>
				reHAB is Cornell iGEM's novel solution for algal bloom toxin recognition and degredation.<br/>
				<br/>Our project consists of:<br/>
				A bioreactor that is to be placed in a water treatment plant <br/> 
				An automatic sampler to be placed in a boat that will take water samples from different locations in a lake and bring them back to shore without contamination<br/>
				A boat to carry the automatic sampler
				<br/><br/>
				Bioreactor - We were given the bacteria that were engineered to degrade microcystins (the toxin) by the wetlab team. I helped to build a packed bed bioreactor to facilitate the flow of water from a water treatment plant through it and ensure interaction with the bacteria.
				<br/>
				How? <br/>
				I created alginate beads and encapsulated the bacteria in these beads. I then helped create the bioreactor with them. Our bioreactor consists of a pump to pump the water through our reactor, a 3D-printed nozzle to spread the water out around the reactor and ensure mixing with the beads, a container with filters on each end to keep the bacteria inside, and our alginate bead encapsulated bacteria. I also used Fusion to 3D print a holder for the bioreactor. Following its creation, I helped mathematically model the reactor. Specifically, I modelled mass transfer. 
				<br/><br/>
				Automatic sampler - The current sampling method for algal bloom toxins in a lake is to have a person go around the lake and take samples. This is very time consuming and inefficient, as well as dangerous. I designed an automated sampler to take samples at certain GPS points throughout the lake and not allow these samples to contaminate one another. 
				<br/>
				How? <br/>
				Our design consists of a vacuum pump connected to solenoid valves. Each of these valves is connected to a test tube and from each of these test tubes runs a tube to the water. An arduino controls the opening and closing of each solenoid valve at the correct GPS locations. When the valves is open, the pump sucks in water from the lake which then falls into the test tube. Before the water level gets too high and spills out towards the solenoid, the valve closes. At the next GPS location, the next valve opens and the process repeats. 
				<br/> Used with: 
				<br/> Our wetlab team engineered RNA aptamers that will change color when exposed to microcystins in water. The water from each test tube can simply be mixed with the solution created by our wetlab team to see if each location has harmful toxins from algal blooms. I also helped create a standard curve for the colorimetric test and statistically determine whether our bioreactor was effective.	
				<br/><br/>
				Boat - The automatic sampler needed to be put on a boat, so we built one. I helped to build a boat that travels throughout any lake and knows where and when to take samples.
				<br/>
				How? <br/> We laser printed the boat parts from plexiglass sheets and then glued them together using waterproof glue. We built two small prototypes before deciding on the final design. The boat has two motors in the back as well as a steering mechanism using a simple servo. We attached an arduino microcontroller to control the boat. This is also attached to a GPS module so the boat can be directed to specific locations to take samples. 
				<br/><br/>
				Result: We successfully created all parts of our project, making a fully functional detection and remediation system for harmful algal blooms. We competed with our project in Boston this fall (2019) and won a gold medal for our work.

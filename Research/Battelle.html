				<h4>Summer 2020</h4>
				<p>
				I was an electrical engineering intern in the Medical Devices group at Battelle. 
				<br/><br/><br/>
				<b> NeuroLife</b> 
				<br/><br/>
				A neural bypass technology to give paralyzed patients conscious control of their fingers, hand, and wrist. My internship also included work on a sleeve for assessment and rehabilitation after stroke injuries.
				<br/>
				Details about my specific work will be added when I ask what info can be made public.

				<b> CCDS Mask Decontamination System</b> 
				<br/><br/>
				Addresses the shortage of critical care PPE. It is designed to work on N95 respirators to remove the novel coronavirus. The FDA granted Battelle an emergency use authorization to implement the system in hospitals nationwide (with a federal contract of $413 million).
				<br/>
				Details about my specific work will be added when I ask what info can be made public. My work was heavily focused on MATLAB.

				<b>Other projects and details</b>
				<br/><br/>
				<b>Underwater Adhesive Testing - Chatillon TCD200 Python Script</b>
				<br/>
				I was asked to establish serial communication between a computer and the Chatillon machine. The researchers wanted to place their underwater adhesive under the hanging force gauge, use their computer to start the test, have the machine move down at a specific rate while recording the force on the force gauge in an excel file with the time, then stop at a specified distance
				and return to the initial position. I started by reading the manual to determine the serial communication parameters (baud rate, parity, stop bits, etc.). I then wrote a Python script utilizing Pyserial to establish 2-way communication. I worked with the researchers to set the parameters they wanted and it worked as intended!

				<b>Demo boards</b>
				<br/>
				Details on this will probably not be added.

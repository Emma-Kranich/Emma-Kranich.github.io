				<h4>Summer 2017</h4>
				<p>
				I interned at the Neural Stem Cell Institute in Rensselaer, NY. There, I assisted research staff in developing regenerative stem cell therapies for diseases of the central nervous system. Over the summer, I improved my basic lab techniques such as pipetting, staining, microscopy, gel electrophoresis, feeding cells, and cleaning cells. It was a great opportunity as a high school student to interact with such esteemed researchers such as MacArthur Fellowship winner Sally Temple while I was in the process of deciding what I wanted to do with my life. One project that stood out to me the most at NSCI was their spinal cord project. They made stem beads that released activating factor to differentiate stem cells and reverse the effects of paralysis. I loved that the research I was a part of had such impactful applications in the real world. Seeing the effects of their treatments and how they could improve real people's lives in such dramatic ways contributed to me falling in love with the field of biomedical engineering and led me to my research projects at Cornell. <br/><br/>

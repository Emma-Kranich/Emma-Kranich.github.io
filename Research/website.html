				<h4>2019</h4>
				<p>
				I have never had much exposure to website design, or computer science in general. In high school, I was in the first computer science class ever offered, intro to CS in Python. This was in my junior year and the teacher, although a great teacher, was learning it with us. During my senior year, I took AP computer science (also the first time it was offered), which was an online program in my high school and was taught in Java. <br/><br/> 

				When I got to college, I was interacting with kids that seemed to know everything there was to know about computers and computer science. They've made app after app, built computers, and made their own websites. Although slightly intimidated, I realized the potential that CS had and all of the possible applications. I decided to teach myself more, as there wasn't much room in my schedule trying to balance my major with extra BME classes. <br/><br/> 

				I heard HTML and CSS where fairly simple to teach yourself, so that is where I began. By watching many YouTube videos and after many "how do you ___ in CSS" google searches, I now have a basic understanding of both. That is how this website was born. In no way am I claiming to be an expert at either HTML or CSS nor am I claiming this website is all my original work. As I said, a lot of lines were taken from youtube videos or google searches and I did not credit each individual line, sorry. In addition, I do not know JavaScript or mobile conversions and none of that is mine. The credits should still be in the files. <br/><br/>

				To be completely honest about the design, I didn't want to use any pictures because I wasn't sure the proper protocol about putting other people's pictures on your own website and I am definitely not a photographer. However, I was also inspired by the beauty of CS and how words in a program can make this all function. I decided to create the design inspired by the look of a CS code. <br/><br/>

				This is not the perfect website by any means and was mostly a way for me to experiment and try something new. Hope it doesn't crash on you and I look forward to more creations in the future - stay tuned for my first app launch?

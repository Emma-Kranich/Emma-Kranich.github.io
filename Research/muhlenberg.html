				<h4>Summer 2017</h4>
				<p>
				I was selected for a free, all-expense-paid week-long program at Muhlenberg College where I had the opportunity to conduct research with a professor on memory consolidation and PTSD (along with a small group of fellow students). It has been shown that playing Tetris in hospitals actually reduces PTSD <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004153" target="_blank">(Read here)</a>. Going off this research, we were interested in how working memory gets consolidated. We had participants play a virtual reality car shop game, then half of the participants played a different VR tetris-like game while the other half sat in a room silently. Both groups were given a free recall test where the group sitting silently scored significantly better. However, when given a multiple choice test, surprisingly, both groups scored the same. Although just a small scale study, the results demonstrated that memories can be hidden from retrieval without being erased by using a visuospatial distractor during the consolidation phase. At the end of the week, we had a poster presentation where I learned how to create a poster as well as present it. Following the conclusion of brain camp, the research was picked up by Muhlenberg students to test on a larger scale. <br/><br/> 

				Since, I have gained more experience with poster presentations and find obvious flaws, but our poster presentation can be viewed <a href="BrainCamp.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>

				During this camp, I was also given the opportunity to hold an actual human brain, which was amazing and further sparked my interest in neuroscience.

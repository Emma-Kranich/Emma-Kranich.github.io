				<h4>2019 - Present</h4>
				<p>
				
				I work in the David Erickson's Lab on campus (Cornell University), which is a mechanical engineering lab with many biomedical engineering Ph.D. students. Their focus is point-of-care diagnostic devices for low resource settings. I starting working here January during my Freshman year, worked through my freshman summer here, and continue to do research here. 
				<br/><br/><br/>
				Project 1: HIV diagnostic testing using H.E.R.M.E.S.<br/><br/>
				Some background: <br/>
				Because of CLIA protocol, centrifuges are restricted to laboratory environments (including hospitals) and cannot be used in minute clinics or pharmacies, which is why you cannot do blood tests at your local CVS. They also require a large amount of energy to function. At the point of care in most cases, especially in low resource setting, centrifuges are not available for use. Because of this, it makes it difficult to run blood tests in these settings.<br/><br/>
				A Ph.D. researcher in the Erickson Lab figured out a way to use magnetic beads that attach to red blood cell antibodies. This solution is then lyophilized so tubes containing these beads can be transported an stored for a long period of time. At the point of care, blood can be mixed in these tubes and red blood cells can be separated from whole blood using a magnet rather than a centrifuge: <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2018/LC/C8LC00939B#!divAbstract" target = "_blank">Read about H.E.R.M.E.S. here</a><br/><br/>
				Red blood cells are a main inhibitor of real-time qPCR, which amplifies DNA and uses fluorescence to quantify it. In diagnosing diseases, the DNA in white blood cells can be amplified with a fluorescent probe that attaches to a known disease sequence to quantify the presence of the disease.
				<br/><br/>
				My work:<br/>
				Although the H.E.R.M.E.S. device separates out red blood cells, the main inhibitor of qPCR, those are not the only inhibitors and because different people have different amounts of proteins, platelets, etc. in their blood, qPCR can still not be used simply. Alongside a Ph.D. student in the Erickson lab, I've been working on ways to quantify this DNA to diagnose HIV, but this could be applied to any disease with known DNA sequences in white blood cells. One idea was to use a known amount of known DNA with a different fluorescent marker and compare the amplifications for quantification. However, we've been running into some problems with this method. Although this is still our current plan, we are still working on creating a solution for the PCR reaction where the known sequence has equal amplification efficiency as the disease sequence and the amound of one does not affect the amplification of the other. <br/><br/>
				More coming soon...

				Project 2: Blood stability using H.E.R.M.E.S.<br/><br/>
				Some background: <br/>
				See above for explanation of limited centrifuge use. Because of this limited centrifuge use, standard blood tests including basic metabolic panels cannot be done unless in a lab or hospital setting. Currently, you have to go somewhere special to get blood drawn and they test it immediately (within an hour). This is because the concentrations of blood particles are not stable. If you let blood sit, regardless of whether it is in a fridge or room temperature, the blood test will be inaccurate. Some of the changes that occur such as sodium and potassium level changes are actually because of the red blood cells. When blood is out of the body, certain functions don't work and the cells run out of energy (glucose). When certain pumps stop working, diffusion of certain particles occurs between the plasma and red blood cells. The plasma concentrations are what is measured so the diffusions disturbs results.
				<br/><br/>
				My work: <br/>
				Our idea was that if we take out red blood cells from the blood using the H.E.R.M.E.S. device, blood can sit out longer before being tested and still give accurate basic metabolic panel results. The application of this would be the ability for you to get blood drawn essentially anywhere, such as your local pharmacy, and get it sent to a lab or hospital. This would also allow for basic blood tests to be done for people living in low resource settings where that is currently not possible. We are currently running trials.

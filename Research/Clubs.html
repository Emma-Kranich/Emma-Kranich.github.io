				<!--<h4>2019 - Present</h4>
				<p>
				
				I work in the Erickson Lab on campus (Cornell University) and did research here over the summer as well.
				<br/><br/>
				Project 1: Blood testing using H.E.R.M.E.S.<br/><br/>
				Some background: <br/>
				Because of CLIA protocol, centrifuges are restricted to laboratory environments (including hospitals) and cannot be used at the point of care in most cases, especially in low resource setting. Because of this, it makes it difficult to run blood tests in these settings.<br/><br/>
				A Ph.D. researcher in the Erickson lab figured out a way to use magnetic beads that attach to antibodies in order to separate out red blood cells from whole blood using a magnet rather than a centrifuge: <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2018/LC/C8LC00939B#!divAbstract" target = "_blank">Read about H.E.R.M.E.S. here</a><br/><br/>
				Red blood cells are a main inhibitor of real-time qPCR, which amplifies DNA and uses fluorescence to quantify it. In diagnosing diseases, the DNA in white blood cells can be amplified with a fluorescent probe that attaches to a known disease sequence to quantify the presence of the disease.
				<br/><br/>
				My work:<br/>
				Although the H.E.R.M.E.S. device separates out red blood cells, the main inhibitor of qPCR, those are not the only inhibitors and because different people have different amounts of proteins, platelets, etc. in their blood, qPCR can still not be used simply. Alongside a Ph.D. student in the Erickson lab, I've been working on ways to quantify this DNA. One idea was to use a known amount of known DNA with a different fluorescent marker and compare the amplifications for quantification. However, we've been running into some problems with this method. <br/><br/>
				More coming soon...

				<h4>2018 - Present</h4>
				<p>
				In high school, I took a 3-year science research course. In this course, I chose a focus area, which was the interaction of technology and neuroscience. I spent 3 years reading science journal publications, making bi-weekly presentations on them, and reaching out to researchers. Although none of this was made up of my own novel ideas and was before I began doing research of my own, I learned how to read scientific publications in my sophomore year of high school, which I think is an extremely important skill. I also got to practice public speaking and became more and more comfortable talking in front of a crowd. At the end of the course, we had to give a longer presentation where members of the community could attend. This helped me learn to determine importance of things as I had to search through years of research to put together the presentation.

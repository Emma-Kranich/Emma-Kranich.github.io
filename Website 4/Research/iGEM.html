				<h4>2018 - Present</h4>
				<p>
				I'm a member of the product development subteam for Cornell iGEM. Every year, we design and build a project for the international competition in Boston, MA. The product development team utilizes the genetically engineered bacteria that our wetlab team creates and makes a functional product that can be used in the real world. We explore user needs, make problem statements, design and prototype, create specifications, and prepare for manafacturing. 
				<br/><br/>
				As a member of the product development team, I've learned about design thinking, prototyping, CAD, circuitry, and got machine shop training. I've also learned a lot by working on a team where each member has such a different background and skill set. 
				<br/><br/>
				2019 Project - Bloomba<br/>
				Bloomba is Cornell iGEM's novel solution for algal bloom toxin recognition and degredation.<br/>
				Our project consists of:<br/>
				A bioreactor that is to be placed in a water treatment plant<br/>
				An automatic sampler to be placed in a boat that will take water samples from different locations in a lake and bring them back to shore without contamination<br/>
				A boat to carry the automatic sampler
				<br/><br/>
				Bioreactor - We were given the bacteria that were engineered to degrade microcystins (the toxin) by the wetlab team and encapsulated. I helped to build a packed bed bioreactor to facilitate the flow of water from a water treatment plant through it and ensure interaction with the bacteria. 
				<br/>
				How? Coming soon...
				<br/><br/>
				Automatic sampler - The current sampling method for algal bloom toxins in a lake is to have a person go around the lake and take samples. This is very time consuming and inefficient. I helped to design an automated sampler using solenoid valves to take samples at certain time points throughout the lake and not allow these samples to contaminate one another.
				<br/>
				How? Coming soon...
				<br/><br/>
				Boat - The automatic sampler needed to be put on a boat, so we built one. I helped to build a boat that travels throughout any lake, and knows where and when to take samples.
				<br/>
				How? Coming soon...

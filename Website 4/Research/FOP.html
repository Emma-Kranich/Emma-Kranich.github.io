				<p>
				FOP is a disease where tissues in the body get ossified and turn to bone. This is also known as "stone-man syndrome." Any trauma to the body can cause inflammation and more rapid ossification. Surgical removal of extra bone growth is known to cause the body to repair itself with even more bone. This disease is severely debilitating and leaves adults (though at different rates) stuck essentially frozen in one position. Most patients are bedridden by age 20 and have a life expectancy of 40 years. There is currently no cure for FOP. <br/><br/>

				Recently, a childhood friend's younger sister was diagnosed with FOP. A group of friends and I from Albany that knew her, along with our parents, helped to organize and run 2 big charity events for FOP research. The first was in 2015, soon after she was diagnosed, and was called "Awake for a Cure." The girl diagnosed was in middle school at the time and this took place there. At the event, middle school students stayed up the entire night at the school participating in games and events. There were also live performances and food donations. The second event was targeted towards adults and was called "Cheers for a Cure." This was in 2017 and included food and a silent auction as well as guest speakers. In total, these 2 events raised $76,000 for the international FOP research center at the University of Pennsylvania.
